<h3><i>I consider an incoming pair of nodes. If both of the nodes are already in 
my network then the strength is incremented. Links with an anchor point at one 
end are strengthened more. If neither node is in my network I 
ignore it. Otherwise I add the missing node to my network.</i></h3>
<p>I also record all the repetitions of links and nodes to be used to calculate 
frequencies.</p>

<h2>Related micro-behaviours</h2>
<p>This relies upon <a href="COPY-BELIEF-NODE.html">COPY-BELIEF-NODE</a> and
<a href="BELIEF-NODE-REPEATED.html">BELIEF-NODE-REPEATED</a>.</p>
<h2>How this works</h2>
<p>This expects my-incoming-transmissions to be a list of triples. Each triple 
contains two nodes (either anchor points or belief nodes) and the identity of 
the sender. It tests if the nodes are already known to this agent by seeing if 
the incoming nodes are copies (with the same value for my-prototype).</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Ken Kahn implemented this on 19 May, 2010.&nbsp; On 31 July 2010 it was 
changed to maintain records of repetitions.
