<h1>Guide to Modelling Epidemic Interventions</h1>
<h2>Step 0. Create or load the Susceptible/Infected Model 
with a social network following a power law</h2>
<p>Create a model using <a href="Epidemic-Guide.html">
this guide for modelling epidemics</a> or  
<a href="http://modelling4all.nsms.ox.ac.uk/Model?frozen=Y_8asKjj4wBtrim6Wdxz48&MforAllModel=1">Load this Epidemic Model</a> corresponding 
to completing step 7 in the guide. If you do load the model we recommend you 
read <a href="Epidemic-Guide.html">the guide for modelling epidemics</a> before 
proceeding.</p>
<h2>Step 1. Introduce Recovery to the model</h2>
<p>The model does not implement recovery from an infection. To remedy this add
<a href="RECOVERY-POSSIBLE-AFTER-INFECTION.html">
RECOVERY-POSSIBLE-AFTER-INFECTION</a> to <b>Person</b> in your model. This 
micro-behaviour needs a slider to 
define the average duration of an infection. Add this
<a href="http://modelling4all.nsms.ox.ac.uk/Resources/Composer/en/MB/CREATE-SLIDER.html#changes=7P9C7Kzm099dRHAXpWM97g">slider customised for this purpose</a> to the 
<b>Observer</b>. 
Run your model. Click on the SETUP button to generate new initial conditions.</p>
<h2>
Step 2. Introduce limited random vaccinations</h2>
<p>Next we model a public health authority with only a limited amount of a 
vaccine. (If you created your model from scratch then you need to create a new prototype for the public health 
authority and add <a href="HIDE.html">HIDE</a> to it since it shouldn't be seen 
when animating the model.) Add to the <b>Public Health Authority</b> a
<a href="http://modelling4all.nsms.ox.ac.uk/Resources/Composer/en/MB.2/CREATE-SLIDER.html#changes=m6_gme31ihtT5wExl65H79">slider to define the amount of vaccine available</a>. The vaccine may only be 
effective for a fraction of those that receive it. To model this add a
<a href="http://modelling4all.nsms.ox.ac.uk/Resources/Composer/en/MB.2/CREATE-SLIDER.html#changes=BYSgqKc1uL4WVIscIEJ-6f">slider customised to define the fraction of vaccinations that take</a> 
to <b>Public Health Authority</b>.</p>
<p>One intervention strategy would be to distribute the 
available vaccine randomly among those who are susceptible. 
<a href="VACCINATE-N-RANDOM-INDIVIDUALS.html">VACCINATE-N-RANDOM-INDIVIDUALS</a> 
does this after
<a href="http://modelling4all.nsms.ox.ac.uk/Resources/Composer/en/MB.2/CREATE-SLIDER.html#changes=4CbZFuiAlddDTmXtA1aM56">a delay defined by this slider</a>. Add both of them to <b>Public Health Authority.</b></p>
<p>To plot the vaccinations you should 
add 
<a href="ADD-VACCINATED-TO-POPULATIONS-PLOT.html">
ADD-VACCINATED-TO-POPULATIONS-PLOT</a> to the
<b>Observer</b>.<p>Run your model.<h2>
Step 3. Introduce 
targeted vaccinations</h2>
<p>
It would be better to vaccinate those who are susceptible <i>and</i> acquaintances of those currently 
infected. But it may take longer to reach these people so we can model this by 
replacing&nbsp; 
<a href="VACCINATE-N-RANDOM-INDIVIDUALS.html">VACCINATE-N-RANDOM-INDIVIDUALS</a> 
(best to inactivate it to simplify comparisons) with 
<a href="VACCINATE-N-RANDOM-SUSCEPTIBLE-ACQUAINTANCES-OF-THE-INFECTED.html">
VACCINATE-N-RANDOM-SUSCEPTIBLE-ACQUAINTANCES-OF-THE-INFECTED</a>.
<a href="VACCINATE-N-RANDOM-SUSCEPTIBLE-ACQUAINTANCES-OF-THE-INFECTED.html">
VACCINATE-N-RANDOM-SUSCEPTIBLE-ACQUAINTANCES-OF-THE-INFECTED</a> is by default 
delayed one time unit more than
<a href="VACCINATE-N-RANDOM-INDIVIDUALS.html">VACCINATE-N-RANDOM-INDIVIDUALS</a> 
to model the delay caused by finding the acquaintances of those infected.</p>
<p>
Run your model.</p>
<h2>Step 4. Explore the trade-offs</h2>
<p>Which strategy leads to smaller epidemics? Does it always better? Run 
variants of your model several times to explore these questions. Keep records of 
the results to add to the classroom whiteboard.&nbsp; Does the best policy 
depend upon the timing of the intervention? On the size of additional delay 
caused by targeting? </p>
