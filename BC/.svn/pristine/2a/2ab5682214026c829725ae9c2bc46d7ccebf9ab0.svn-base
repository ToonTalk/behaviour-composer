	<a title="INITIALISE-SOCIAL-NETWORK-SYMMETRIC" href="INITIALISE-SOCIAL-NETWORK-CONSTANT-SYMMETRIC.html">

	INITIALISE-SOCIAL-NETWORK-CONSTANT-SYMMETRIC</a> differs from this one in that the 

	distribution of the number of acquaintances is a constant.

	<a title="INITIALISE-SOCIAL-NETWORK-NORMAL-DISTRIBUTION-SYMMETRIC" href="INITIALISE-SOCIAL-NETWORK-NORMAL-DISTRIBUTION-SYMMETRIC.html">

	INITIALISE-SOCIAL-NETWORK-NORMAL-DISTRIBUTION-SYMMETRIC</a> has a normal 

	distribution.</p>

	<a title="DISPLAY-LINE-TO-EACH-OF-MY-ACQUAINTANCES" href="DISPLAY-LINE-TO-EACH-OF-MY-ACQUAINTANCES.html">

	DISPLAY-LINE-TO-EACH-OF-MY-ACQUAINTANCES</a> draws line between 

	acquaintances.

	<a title="SET-SIZE-PROPORTIONAL-TO-NUMBER-OF-MY-ACQUAINTANCES" href="SET-SIZE-PROPORTIONAL-TO-NUMBER-OF-MY-ACQUAINTANCES.html">

	SET-SIZE-PROPORTIONAL-TO-NUMBER-OF-MY-ACQUAINTANCES</a> sets the size of the 

	display of individuals to be proportional to the number of acquaintances.

	</p>

	<h2>How this works</h2>

	<p>Each link is added to two random members of the population with a 

	probability that is proportional to the number of links each member has. 
	This is accomplished by adding duplicates to the list of <i>linkees</i>. The 

	code ensures that no duplicate or self links are created.</p>
