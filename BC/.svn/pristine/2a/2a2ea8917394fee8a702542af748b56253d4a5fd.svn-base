	<h2><span class="mw-headline">Variants </span></h2>
	<p>You can alter
	<a title="COMPUTE-SEASONAL-GROWTH-FACTOR" href="COMPUTE-SEASONAL-GROWTH-FACTOR.html">COMPUTE-SEASONAL-GROWTH-FACTOR</a> to model seasons differently. </p>
	<h2><span class="mw-headline">Related Micro-behaviours </span></h2>
	<p>
	<a title="COMPUTE-SEASONAL-GROWTH-FACTOR" href="COMPUTE-SEASONAL-GROWTH-FACTOR.html">COMPUTE-SEASONAL-GROWTH-FACTOR</a> computes the growth factor based upon the 
	current season and is required for this to work. </p>
	<p>
	<a title="GROW-SUGAR-SEASONALLY-DELAYED" href="GROW-SUGAR-SEASONALLY-DELAYED.html">GROW-SUGAR-SEASONALLY-DELAYED</a> uses this and ensures this is run after 
	agents have finished collecting sugar.
	<a title="GROW-SUGAR" href="GROW-SUGAR.html">GROW-SUGAR</a> is simpler and does 
	not model seasonal geographical differences. </p>
	<h2><span class="mw-headline">How this works </span></h2>
	<p>Sugar is incremented up to the limit of the <i>sugar-capacity-of-patch</i> 
	of each patch. It is incremented by the patch's growth rate multiplied by a 
	factor to account for different seasonal growth rates. </p>
