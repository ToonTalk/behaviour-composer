	<p><b>MOVE FORWARD</b></p>
	<font size="2" color="gray">Begin NetLogo code:</font>
	<pre>substitute-text-area-for columns: 66 speed 1

	<h2>Variants</h2>
	<p>The value in the second edit box is the speed (in patches per second) of this agent. It can be changed to any 
	numeric value or replaced by the value of a slider, an attribute, or a 
	generated random number.
	You can also update the frequency that this run by editing the first text 
	area.</p>
	<h2>Related Micro-behaviours</h2>

	<p>Any behaviour that changes my heading can work together with this to produce 
	non-linear motion. Examples are
	<a title="TURN-RANDOMLY" href="TURN-RANDOMLY.html">TURN-RANDOMLY</a>,
	<a title="TURN-TOWARDS-GOAL" href="TURN-TOWARDS-GOAL.html">TURN-TOWARDS-GOAL</a>, 
	and
	<a title="TURN-IN-DIRECTION-AT-MAXIMUM-SPEED" href="TURN-IN-DIRECTION-AT-MAXIMUM-SPEED.html">
	TURN-IN-DIRECTION-AT-MAXIMUM-SPEED</a>.</p>
	<h2>How this works</h2>
	<p>This moves the agent in the direction of its current heading by a constant 
	amount on each cycle.</p>
	<h2>History</h2>


	<p>This was implemented by Ken Kahn.</p>
