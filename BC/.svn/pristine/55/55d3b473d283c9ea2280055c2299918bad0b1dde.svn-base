	<h3><i>I record a movie of a model's execution.</i> </h3>
	<p><i>Warning -- this does not 

	compress the movie so the file will be very large. You probably want to 

	compress the movie with some other tool subsequently. The movie is made in 
	Apple's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickTime">QuickTime</a> 
	format but can be converted to other formats.</i></p>
	<p><i>This only works 
	when the model is run from within NetLogo. Applets can't create movies.</i></p>

	<font size="2" color="gray">Begin NetLogo code:</font>

   [create-movie &quot;test-movie.mov&quot; 50 true]

	<h2>Related Micro-behaviours</h2>
	<p><a href="SET-DELTA-T.html">SET-DELTA-T</a> can be used to set the 
	duration of each frame (in seconds).</p>
	<h2><span class="mw-headline">Variants </span></h2>

	<p>You can change the file name of the movie (&quot;test-movie.mov&quot; here) and 

	the number of frames to record (50 in this example). Changing <i>true</i> to
	<i>false</i> will cause the movie to include the entire interface.</p>

	<h2><span class="mw-headline">How it works </span></h2>

	<p>This produces a QuickTime movie file named &quot;test-movie.mov&quot;. 
	The file will be created relative to the folder where the NLOGO file was 
	downloaded unless an absolute file name is given.</p>

	<h2><span class="mw-headline">History </span></h2>

	<p>This was implemented by Ken Kahn. </p>
