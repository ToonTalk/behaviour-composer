<title>MOVE-TO-NEAREST-PREFERRED-VISIBL</title>

</head>

<body>
	<h3><i>I move to the unoccupied site with the most sugar that I can see. My 

	vision is restricted to a maximum distance north/south and east/west. In the 

	case of equally good sites, I move to the nearest.</i> </h3>

	<p>This <b>requires</b> another micro-behaviour to implement the <i>

	preferred-patch</i> procedure. You can use

	<a title="PREFER-PATCH-WITH-MORE-SUGAR" href="PREFER-PATCH-WITH-MORE-SUGAR.html">

	PREFER-PATCH-WITH-MORE-SUGAR</a> or

	<a title="PREFER-PATCH-WITH-GREATER-SUGAR-TO-POLLUTION-RATIO" href="PREFER-PATCH-WITH-GREATER-SUGAR-TO-POLLUTION-RATIO.html">

	PREFER-PATCH-WITH-GREATER-SUGAR-TO-POLLUTION-RATIO</a>. </p>

	<h2><span class="mw-headline">Variants </span></h2>

	<p>One can model vision as seeing anything within a radius rather than only 

	in the four compass directions. The preference is implemented by <i>

	preferred-patch</i> and one can provide alternative implementations such as

	<a title="PREFER-PATCH-WITH-MORE-SUGAR" href="PREFER-PATCH-WITH-MORE-SUGAR.html">

	PREFER-PATCH-WITH-MORE-SUGAR</a> and

	<a title="PREFER-PATCH-WITH-GREATER-SUGAR-TO-POLLUTION-RATIO" href="PREFER-PATCH-WITH-GREATER-SUGAR-TO-POLLUTION-RATIO.html">

	PREFER-PATCH-WITH-GREATER-SUGAR-TO-POLLUTION-RATIO</a>. </p>

	<a title="INITIALISE-VISION-LEVEL" href="INITIALISE-VISION-LEVEL.html">

	INITIALISE-VISION-LEVEL</a> initialises <i>my-vision-level</i>. </p>

	<h2><span class="mw-headline">How this works </span></h2>

	<p>First this computes the <i>sites</i> that can be seen. It then updates 

	the sites to include where I am and removes all sites that are currently 

	occupied. The first of these sites, if there are any, is where I move. Note 

	that sites are produced in order of distance so in the case of equally 

	preferred sites the closest one is chosen. </p>
