	<a title="PREFER-PATCH-WITH-MORE-SUGAR" href="PREFER-PATCH-WITH-MORE-SUGAR.html">

	PREFER-PATCH-WITH-MORE-SUGAR</a> implements a preference for more sugar 

	without regard to pollution levels..</p>

	<h2>Related Micro-behaviours</h2>


	<p>This can be used by

	<a title="MOVE-TO-NEAREST-PREFERRED-VISIBLE-PATCH" href="MOVE-TO-NEAREST-PREFERRED-VISIBLE-PATCH.html">

	MOVE-TO-NEAREST-PREFERRED-VISIBLE-PATCH</a>.</p>

	<h2>How this works</h2>

	<p>It reports TRUE if the sugar to pollution ratio of the first patch is 

	greater than or equal to the second patch. Since pollution may be zero, 1 is 

	added to avoid a division by zero.</p>

	<h2>History</h2>



	<p>This was implemented by Ken Kahn.</p>
