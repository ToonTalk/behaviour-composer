    The <i>Behaviour Composer</i> is a web-based tool designed to support teachers, 
	learners and researchers, including those with little or no programming 
	experience, to build, share, and discuss agent-based computer models.
	It has been integrated with Google Translate and can be run in over 60 languages.

    You can use the Behaviour Composer without installing anything. However, you will then need to manually download files generated by the Behaviour Composer to <a href='https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/' target='_blank'>NetLogo</a> (or if your browser is configured to run NetLogo as Java applets) then use
    <a href="m/index.html" target="_blank" title="Click here to create and run computer models using applets or manual downloads to NetLogo."
       >this version of the Behaviour Composer</a> or <a href="p/en/sse.html" target="_blank" title="Click here to make your own epidemic game using applets or manual downloads to NetLogo.">this version of the Epidemic Game Maker</a>.
       The Epidemic Game Maker provides a way to quickly and easily make models of epidemics and turn the models into games.

     <p>My experience when we use the Behaviour Composer tool is that all 
		students are fully involved in building the Sugarscape model, testing 
		various assumptions, and seeing what conclusions they can draw. This is 
		no mean feat! Many colleagues at other business schools are quite 
		surprised, to say the least, when I tell them that we get an entire 
		class of MBA students to build agent-based models.<br/><cite>Dr. Felix

     <p>Modelling4All, combined with the support of Ken and Howard, enabled me 
		to produce easily and quickly an absorbing and stimulating computer 
		practical for my undergraduate students. In my case, the practical 
		allowed the students to study and manipulate the spread and control of a 
		hypothetical disease, in particular exploring the role of infection 
		networks, but I see the possibilities of Modelling4All in teaching many 
		areas of biology, and have recommended it to my colleagues.<br/><cite>

    <blockquote>
    <p>The Behavioral Composer is an extremely helpful tool for all those who
       are new to agent-based modelling. It enables students in getting familiar
       with this type of bottom-up modelling in a relatively short time, and
       immediate results in terms of animations enhance students’ excitement
       for learning more about this modelling approach.<br/><cite>

    <blockquote>
     <p>Since being introduced to the platform in October 2008, we have been 
		using M4A in our organisation (a research institute). Not only have we 
		made significant headway on our modelling projects, but we have been 
		able to make the process more participatory, sharing models and 
		interacting easily with a range of different people. This has been fun 
		for me and for others in our team...Thank you!<br/><cite>Dr. Richard 
		Taylor, Stockholm Environment Institute</cite></p>

    <blockquote>
     <p>If you are not trained in programming languages, the Modelling4All project gives you the tool
     you need for building complex agent-based models in a very fast and effective way. 
     And you can easily share your results in an interdisciplinary community. 
     The Modelling4All project is fantastic for an archaeologist like me who explores new methods
     in my field.<br/><cite>
