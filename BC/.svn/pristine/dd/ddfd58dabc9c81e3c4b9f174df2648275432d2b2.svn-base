	<h2>Variants</h2>

	<p>This models the odds of a new individual being successfully vaccinated as 

	the product of <i>the-fraction-vaccinated-at-birth</i> which is controllable by 

	policies and <i>the-fraction-of-vaccinations-that-take</i> which is a parameter 

	determined by the technology. You can remove &quot;POSSIBLY-LOSE-IMMUNITY&quot; if a 

	vaccination is always life-long. </p>

	<h2>Related Micro-behaviours</h2>


	<p>This probabilistically adds the

	<a title="SET-STATE-VACCINATED" href="SET-STATE-VACCINATED.html">

	SET-STATE-VACCINATED</a> and

	<a title="POSSIBLY-LOSE-IMMUNITY" href="POSSIBLY-LOSE-IMMUNITY.html">

	POSSIBLY-LOSE-IMMUNITY</a> micro-behaviours. </p>

	<h2>How this works</h2>

	<p>If the product of <i>the-fraction-vaccinated-at-birth</i> and <i>

	the-fraction-of-vaccinations-that-take</i> is less than or equal to a random 

	number between 0 and 1 then the the

	<a title="SET-STATE-VACCINATED" href="SET-STATE-VACCINATED.html">

	SET-STATE-VACCINATED</a> and

	<a title="POSSIBLY-LOSE-IMMUNITY" href="POSSIBLY-LOSE-IMMUNITY.html">

	POSSIBLY-LOSE-IMMUNITY</a> micro-behaviours are added. </p>

	<h2>History</h2>



	<p>This was implemented by Ken Kahn. </p>
