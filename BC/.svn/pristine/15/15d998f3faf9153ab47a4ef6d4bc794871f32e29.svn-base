<h3><font face="Verdana">Background</font></h3>
<p><font face="Verdana">Scientists use computer models to help understand how a 
virus might spread through a population. You can use this model to experiment 
with ways to slow or even stop the spread of an infection. Think about how the 
model relates to the real world, what assumptions does the model make, can you 
give us suggestions for improving it?</font></p>
<h3><font face="Verdana">Explore the model</font></h3>
<p><font face="Verdana">If you click on the <i>Make Your Game</i> button, you'll 
be able run the current model. It starts off where every day students go to 
school and then home again. One student is infected (displayed as yellow with 
red virus). In the model every hour infected people look at how many people are 
at the their location. Using a parameter called <i>the-encounter-rate</i> 
(default value is 1) they choose randomly <i>the-encounter-rate</i> number of 
people. For each person <i>the-infection-odds</i> is used to determine if the 
disease has been transmitted. The default value is .04, i.e., a 4% chance of 
getting infected from this encounter.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">To run the model click the <i>Go</i> button. To start 
over again press the <i>Setup</i> button. Each time it is run a new plot is 
drawn. Here's the result of running the basic model for three trials:</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="../ImagesEGM/plots3.png" width="613" height="182"></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Things to think about:</font></p>
<ul>
	<li><font face="Verdana">Why is each run different? </font></li>
	<li><font face="Verdana">What do they have in common? </font></li>
	<li><font face="Verdana">How predictable is the simulation?</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana">You might find it interesting to see how <i>the-encounter-rate </i>
and<i> the-infection-odds </i>influences how the disease spreads. Go back to the
<i>Epidemic Game Maker</i> and click on the check boxes labelled <i>
<font size="4">Infection odds slider</font></i> and <i><font size="4">Encounter 
rate slider</font></i>. Click the <i>Make Your Game</i> button to make the 
modified simulation. Now you can experiment with different settings for these 
parameters.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Verdana">Change the model</font></h3>
<ul>
	<li><font face="Verdana">Explore enhancement to the model by clicking on <i>
	<font size="4">Add more schools</font></i>. See what happens if you also add
	<i><font size="4">Students go to closest school</font></i>. Are their some 
	students that can't get infected? Why? What happens to those students if you 
	also <i><font size="4">Add work places</font></i>?</font></li>
	<li><font face="Verdana">Explore <font size="4">virus trails</font> that are 
	left behind as infected people move around. The trails are modelling viruses 
	left on surfaces, door knobs, etc. People can now become infected by 
	encountering either infected people or the viruses they left behind. The 
	viruses go away after a while. It may be hard to experiment with everything 
	at once - try removing the extra schools and the work places. Consider 
	changing the infection odds since people are being infected directly and by 
	viruses left behind.</font></li>
</ul>
<h3><font face="Verdana">Turn your model into a game</font></h3>
<p><font face="Verdana">You can add up to four buttons to the model to make it a 
game where the player is trying to stop the epidemic within economic 
constraints.</font></p>
<ul>
	<li><font face="Verdana"><b><i>School closing</i></b> Adds a 
	button that closes all the schools. Pressing it again opens the schools. 
	Students stay home when their school is closed. School closing hurts the 
	economy so the player can only keep them closed while there is money left. 
	What effects does it have on the way the disease spreads?</font></li>
	<li>
	<font face="Verdana"><i><b>Voluntary quarantine ad campaign</b></i>
	Adds a button that each time it is pressed runs an advertising campaign to 
	encourage people to stay home when they are ill. Note that there is a delay 
	from when someone becomes infected and infectious and when they are symptoms 
	and they become aware that they are ill. Each press reaches a random 4% of 
	the population causing them to change their behaviour. See the
	advanced options section below for how to change the 4% 
	value. Each campaign costs one money unit.</font></li>
	<li>
	<font face="Verdana"><i><b>Hand washing ad campaign</b></i> Adds a button that </span></span>runs an advertising 
	campaign to encourage people to wash their hands. For those reached by the 
	advert (5%) their odds of getting infected by encountering virus trails is 
	reduced by 50%. See advanced options section below for how 
	to change these parameters.</font></li>
	<li><font face="Verdana">
	<i><b>Catch It, Bin It, Kill It ad campaign</b></i>
	Adds a button that reaches 5% of the population who then leave a trail every 
	5 hours instead of every hour. </span></span>See
	advanced options section below for how to change these 
	parameters.</li>
</ul>

<h3><font face="Verdana"><a name="Advanced_options">Advanced options</a></font></h3>
</font><font face="Verdana">
<p>You can click on the name of a model element and select
<i>Show Details</i>. If you do this for <i>Parameters</i> you'll see all the 
constants. You can <i>Open</i> them and change them. The <i>Observer</i> 
contains behaviours that determine things about the plots, output area, and the 
display of the simulated date.</p>
<p>You can also click on the <i>Advanced Mode</i> check box 
at the bottom of the <i>Epidemic Game Maker</i> to do very advanced things such 
as finding and adding new behaviours (for modelling vaccinations and recovery).</p>
