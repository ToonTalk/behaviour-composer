	<p>An experiment described in [1] has diffusion begin after 100 time units. 

	You can delay by amounts other than <i>delta-t</i> to model different 

	diffusion rates. You can use the 8 neighbors by replacing <i>neighbors4 </i>

	with <i>neighbors</i> and dividing by 9 instead. </p>

	SUGAR-CONSUMPTION-PRODUCES-POLLUTION</a> produce the pollution that this 

	micro-behaviour diffuses. </p>

	<h2><span class="mw-headline">How this works </span></h2>

	<p>It sums up the value of <i>pollution-of-patch</i> of each patch and its 

	neighbors one step north, south, east, and west and divides by 5 to 

	calculate the average. The <i>pollution-of-patch</i> of each patch is set to 

	its average in this way. Note that by setting <i>next-pollution-of-patch</i> 

	rather than <i>pollution-of-patch</i> each patch is updated with the current 

	average of values not yet updated by this diffusion process. </p>
