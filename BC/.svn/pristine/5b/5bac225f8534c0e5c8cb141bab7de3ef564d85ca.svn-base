			<p>Issues that arose while constructing Sugarscape in the 
			BehaviourComposer: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Geography of Sugarscape not specified precisely. My version looks 
		pretty close but is it? And it is not a good terrain given that it wraps 
		since there are artefacts in the upper left and lower right corners.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Sequential update in the implementation of move. The parallel 
		version is better but as footnote 12 points out then conflict resolution 
		needs to be addressed.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Some agents in

		don't move or die. It took a while to understand why. Since the 
		grow-back happens before move there is no need to move unless you see 
		better capacity sites.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>The seasonal migration on page 44 isn't reproducible. Since the 
		agents can only see in compass directions they don't know there is 
		something better at a diagonal. Not clear if they mixed up versions.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>When pollution diffusion begins the agents move to patches with 
		neighbours that have a lower sugar capacity since they have less 
		pollution. No mention of this in the book. Perhaps because I do a 
		simultaneous update in the code for diffusion?
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Pollution seems to produce a more equal distribution of wealth. 
		Maybe since it forces agents to move off of high sugar capacity</li>
	</ul>
