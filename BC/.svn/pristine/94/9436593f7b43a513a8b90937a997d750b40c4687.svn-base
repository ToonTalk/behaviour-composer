	<p>The variable <i>the-personal-space</i> in the above is the value of &#945; in [1]. 

	It can be safely changed to any positive value using the slider defined in

	<a title="CREATE-SLIDER-FOR-PERSONAL-SPACE" href="CREATE-SLIDER-FOR-PERSONAL-SPACE.html">

	CREATE-SLIDER-FOR-PERSONAL-SPACE</a>. If you add <i>and abs angle-from-me &lt;= 

	cone-of-vision</i> to <i>distance-within the-personal-space</i> then only those 

	who are within my cone of vision will be considered. <i>cone-of-vision</i> 

	can be defined by a slider as a variable that ranges from 0 to 180 degrees.

	<h2><span class="mw-headline">To do</span></h2>
	<p><span class="mw-headline">[1] states &quot;Avoidance is the highest priority. 
	If neighbours are not detected within this region then the individual will 
	tend to become attracted towards, and aligned...&quot;. This implementation 
	does <i>not</i> give priority to this 
	behaviour over attraction and alignment behaviours. The priority should only 
	apply if there is a conflict, i.e. the attraction or alignment behaviours 
	compute a desired direction that conflicts with the one computed by this 
	behaviour.</span></p>
