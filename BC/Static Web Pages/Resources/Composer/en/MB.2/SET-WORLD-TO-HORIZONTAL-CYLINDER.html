<body>
	<h3><i>I change the initial geometry of the world to be a horizontal 

	cylinder. In other words, when an individual moves off the top or bottom 

	edge it appears on the opposite edge as if the surface has been rolled into 

	a tube. The individual can move off the right or left edge, however.</i>

	<p><b>SET-WORLD-TO-HORIZONTAL-CYLINDER </b></p>

	<font size="2" color="gray">Begin NetLogo code:</font>
	<pre>set-world-geometry 3

	<font size="2" color="gray">End NetLogo code</font>
	<h2>Variants</h2>

	<p><i>set-world-geometry</i> expects one number which can have any of the 

	following values: </p>

	<ol>

		<li>Torus (wraps horizontally and vertically)

		<a title="SET-WORLD-TO-TORUS" href="SET-WORLD-TO-TORUS.html">

		SET-WORLD-TO-TORUS</a> </li>

		<li>Vertical cylinder (wraps horizontally)

		<a title="SET-WORLD-TO-VERTICAL-CYLINDER" href="SET-WORLD-TO-VERTICAL-CYLINDER.html">

		SET-WORLD-TO-VERTICAL-CYLINDER</a> </li>

		<li>Horizontal cylinder (wraps vertically) <strong class="selflink">

		SET-WORLD-TO-HORIZONTAL-CYLINDER</strong> </li>

		<li>A plane (no wrapping -- objects become invisible if beyond the 

		limits of the world)

		<a title="SET-WORLD-TO-PLANE" href="SET-WORLD-TO-PLANE.html">

		SET-WORLD-TO-PLANE</a> </li>

		<li>A plane with a camera that follows the average position of all 

		individuals

		<a title="SET-WORLD-TO-PLANE-WITH-CAMERA-FOLLOWING-CENTROID" href="SET-WORLD-TO-PLANE-WITH-CAMERA-FOLLOWING-CENTROID.html">

		SET-WORLD-TO-PLANE-WITH-CAMERA-FOLLOWING-CENTROID</a>

		</li>

	</ol>

	<h2>How this works</h2>

	<p>Due to current limitations of NetLogo this specifies only the <i>initial</i> 

	geometry of the world and cannot be used to change the world's geometry 

	during execution. </p>

	<h2>History</h2>



	<p>This was implemented by Ken Kahn. </p>
