	<h2>Variants</h2>

	<p>You can experiment with a different <i>season-length</i> or <i>

	winter-growth-factor</i>. </p>

	<h2>How this works</h2>

	<p>This adds to your model a new NetLogo reporter that can be used by any 

	micro-behaviour. Here it defines <i>seasonal-growth-factor</i> that computes 

	the growth factor of each patch in the model. Every <i>season-length</i> 

	time units it switches factors between the southern and northern halves of 

	Sugarscape. It is used by
