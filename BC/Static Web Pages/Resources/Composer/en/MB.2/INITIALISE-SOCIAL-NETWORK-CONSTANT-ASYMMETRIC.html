	<font size="2" color="gray">Begin NetLogo code:</font>
	<pre>substitute-text-area-for maximum-acquaintances-constant-asymmetric-network 5
do-after-setup
   [set my-acquaintances 
        n-of minimum count all-individuals maximum-acquaintances-constant-asymmetric-network 
             all-individuals]
</pre>

	<font size="2" color="gray">End NetLogo code</font>
	<h2>Variants</h2>

	<p>You can change the 5 to any other number to initialise the subset of the 

	&quot;objects&quot; (or agents) that I know. This can have a distribution of different 

	number of acquaintances by replacing the &quot;5&quot; with something like &quot;round 

	within-range 1 10 random-normal 5 2&quot; to create a distribution with a mean of 

	5 and a standard deviation of 2 truncated to values between 1 and 10 

	inclusive. </p>

	<p>Or you may wish to replace the &quot;5&quot; with a variable defined by a slider 

	for easy experimentation. See

	INITIALISE-SOCIAL-NETWORK-NORMAL-DISTRIBUTION-ASYMMETRIC</a> is similar to 

	this one except the number of acquaintances is normally distributed. An 

	example of the use of this micro-behaviour is

	creates an entire network where if <i>A</i> relates to <i>B</i> then <i>B</i> 
	also relates to <i>A</i>.</p>

	<h2>How this works</h2>

	<p>It randomly selects 5 individuals as <i>my-acquaintances</i>. It is 

	careful to avoid creating more acquaintances than there are individuals by 

	taking the minimum of 5 and the number of individuals. This code is run 

	after setup has completed since it is typically during setup that copies are 

	created. </p>

	<h2>History</h2>



	<p>This was implemented by Ken Kahn. </p>
