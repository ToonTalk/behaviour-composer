<h1 class="firstHeading">Kind</h1>
			<p><i>kind</i> is a variable generated by the BehaviourComposer 
			based upon the name you gave your prototype. Note that comparisons 
			are case sensitive, e.g. <i>kind = &quot;Tree&quot;</i> will not have the same 
			value as <i>kind = &quot;tree&quot;</i>. </p>
	<p>Alternatively, you can create your own type system by inventing variables 
	like <i>my-species</i> or <i>my-type</i>. </p>
