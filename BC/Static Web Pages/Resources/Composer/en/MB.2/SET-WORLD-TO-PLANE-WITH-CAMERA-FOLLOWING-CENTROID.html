	<h3><i>I change the initial geometry of the world to be a flat plane. In 

	other words, when an individual moves off the top, bottom, left or right 

	edge it disappears until it moves back into the viewing area. Furthermore 

	the viewing area moves so that its center is always the average position of 

	all the individuals in the model.</i> </h3>

	<h2>Variants</h2>

	<p><i>set-world-geometry</i> expects one number which can have any of the 

	following values: </p>

	<ol>

		<li>Torus (wraps horizontally and vertically)

		<a title="SET-WORLD-TO-TORUS" href="SET-WORLD-TO-TORUS.html">

		SET-WORLD-TO-TORUS</a> </li>

		<li>Vertical cylinder (wraps horizontally)

		<a title="SET-WORLD-TO-VERTICAL-CYLINDER" href="SET-WORLD-TO-VERTICAL-CYLINDER.html">

		SET-WORLD-TO-VERTICAL-CYLINDER</a> </li>

		<li>Horizontal cylinder (wraps vertically)

		<a title="SET-WORLD-TO-HORIZONTAL-CYLINDER" href="SET-WORLD-TO-HORIZONTAL-CYLINDER.html">

		SET-WORLD-TO-HORIZONTAL-CYLINDER</a> </li>

		<li>A plane (no wrapping -- objects become invisible if beyond the 

		limits of the world)

		<a title="SET-WORLD-TO-PLANE" href="SET-WORLD-TO-PLANE.html">

		SET-WORLD-TO-PLANE</a> </li>

		<li>A plane with a camera that follows the average position of all 

		individuals <strong class="selflink">

		SET-WORLD-TO-PLANE-WITH-CAMERA-FOLLOWING-CENTROID</strong>

		</li>

	</ol>

	<h2>How this works</h2>

	<p>Due to current limitations of NetLogo this specifies only the <i>initial</i> 

	geometry of the world and cannot be used to change the world's geometry 

	during execution. </p>

	<h2>History</h2>



	<p>This was implemented by Ken Kahn. </p>
