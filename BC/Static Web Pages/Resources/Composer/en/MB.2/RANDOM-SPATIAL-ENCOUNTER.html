	<h2>Variants</h2>

	<p>A different formula for biasing the odds to nearby 

	individuals can be used. Additional encounter behaviours can be added.</p>

	<h2>Related Micro-behaviours</h2>

	<p>This relies upon the

	<a title="POSSIBLE-INFECTION" href="POSSIBLE-INFECTION.html">

	POSSIBLE-INFECTION</a> micro-behaviour to possibly infect the other.

	<a title="CREATE-ENCOUNTER-RATE-SLIDER" href="CREATE-ENCOUNTER-RATE-SLIDER.html">

	CREATE-ENCOUNTER-RATE-SLIDER</a> defines <i>the-encounter-rate</i> variable 

	used here. </p>

	<p>

	<a title="RANDOM-ENCOUNTER" href="RANDOM-ENCOUNTER.html">

	RANDOM-ENCOUNTER</a> is like this micro-behaviour without a spatial bias.

	<a title="RANDOM-SOCIAL-ENCOUNTER" href="RANDOM-SOCIAL-ENCOUNTER.html">

	RANDOM-SOCIAL-ENCOUNTER</a> chooses individuals among my set of 

	acquaintances. </p>

	<p>

	<a title="RANDOM-PHYSICAL-ENCOUNTER" href="RANDOM-PHYSICAL-ENCOUNTER.html">

	RANDOM-PHYSICAL-ENCOUNTER</a> chooses individuals that are at my location.

	</p>

	<h2>How this works</h2>

	<p>This models individuals that have <i>the-encounter-rate</i> encounters per 

	unit time period (e.g., a simulated week). Every second, if I'm still infected (i.e., <i>

	my-state = &quot;infected&quot;</i>) then I pick <i>the-encounter-rate</i>&nbsp; other individuals (who are not dead) . Individuals are picked 
	with a probability that is inversely proportional to the square of the 
	distance to me. I give these individuals the micro-behaviour

	<a title="POSSIBLE-INFECTION" href="POSSIBLE-INFECTION.html">

	POSSIBLE-INFECTION</a>. The formula adds 1 to avoid a division by zero if 
	someone is co-located with me. If <i>the-encounter-rate</i> is a non-integer then the 

	remainder is compared with a random number probabilistically to possibly 

	include one additional individual. I also sets the <i>my-last-encounter</i> 

	variable of the other individuals to me in order to keep track of how many 

	infections I cause. </p>
