	UTILITY-OF-NETWORK</a>. <a href="ADD-NETWORK-FORMATION-PROCEDURES.html">ADD-NETWORK-FORMATION-PROCEDURES</a> 
	adds this reporter to the program.</p>

	<h2>How this works</h2>

	<p>This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search">
	breadth-first search</a> recursively calls itself with the list of 
	unexplored nodes one further away than the incoming <i>nodes</i>. If there 
	are no additional nodes to explore it reports the largest NetLogo integer as the 
	distance. If the player is a member of the additional nodes then the current 
	distance is the minimum distance.</p>

	<h2>History</h2>



	<p>This was implemented by Ken Kahn.
