	<pre>when [my-state = &quot;infected&quot;]
     [do-after 1.01 [add-behaviours list-of-micro-behaviours "Possible Recovery Behaviours" [POSSIBLY-RECOVER.html]]]

	<h2>How this works</h2>

	<p>When <a href="SET-STATE-INFECTED.html">SET-STATE-INFECTED</a> runs it sets<i> my-state</i> to <i>infected</i>. If 
	this micro-behaviour has also been added then this will run after that and 
	add the <a href="POSSIBLY-RECOVER.html">POSSIBLY-RECOVER</a> process. This 
	delays adding the micro-behaviour since you can't recover just after getting 
	infected. The delay is 1.01 rather than 1.0 so that this process runs after 
	the processes that model infectious encounters.</p>
	<h2>History</h2>
	<p>This was implemented by Ken Kahn</p>
