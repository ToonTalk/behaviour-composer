<p>Sugarscape is an artificial world with life, death, wealth, sex, culture, 

trade, and disease described in<i> Growing Artificial Societies</i> by Joshua M. 

Epstein and Robert Axtell, Brookings Institute Press, The MIT Press, 1996. Here

<p>Building Sugarscape</p>

</b></i></font><font SIZE="3" face="Tahoma">

</font><font SIZE="4" face="Tahoma"><b>

<p>Step 1. Building the environment</p>

</b></font><font SIZE="3" face="Tahoma">

<p ALIGN="CENTER"></p>

<p>You will start with a model of the Sugarscape where a few 

technical details have been taken care of. To load this model click the
<a href="../../../m/?frozen=HvTRpK7pLZRpcMQryWIP7d&MforAllModel=1">Initial Sugarscape Model</a> 
button and choose 'Replace current model' from the menu. You will see that two 
agents have been created: 'Agent' and 'Sugarscape Environment'. The Sugarscape 
Environment has been created with a number of
<a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html">NetLogo</a> 
code <i>fragments</i> called behaviours. You will build on this model by adding 
more behaviours from the <a href="Sugarscape-Library.html">Sugarscape Library</a>.</p>
<p>The environment needs to be initialised to give it the behaviour of producing 
sugar. To do this you need to add the following behaviours to Sugarscape 
Environment agent:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b><a href="INITIALISE-SUGAR-CAPACITY.html">INITIALISE-SUGAR-CAPACITY</a></b> to 

the Sugarscape Environment so that each patch of the Sugarscape has a 

maximum sugar capacity, </li>
	<li><b><a href="INITIALISE-SUGAR-GROWTH-RATE.html">INITIALISE-SUGAR-GROWTH-RATE</a></b> to set the rate in which sugar grows, 
	</li>
	<li><b><a href="GROW-SUGAR-DELAYED.html">GROW-SUGAR-DELAYED</a></b> to grow the sugar, 

and </li>
	<li><b><a href="UPDATE-PATCH-COLOUR.html">UPDATE-PATCH-COLOUR</a></b> so the 
	patches are coloured to reflect the amount of sugar accumulated. </li>
</ul>
<p>To do this click on each of the links above in turn to go to each behaviour's 
web page. Then click on the button at the top of each behaviour's web page (e.g. 
the button titled 'INITIALISE-SUGAR-CAPACITY'), select 'Add to prototype' from 
the menu, then within 'Composer' area click within the Sugarscape Environment 
box to drop a behaviour onto this specific 'agent' or 'prototype'.</p>
<p>Next click on the 'Run your model' tab within the <span lang="EN-GB">
<a href="#_BehaviourComposer_">Composer Area</a> </span>and 

then click the 'GO' button within the
<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applet">Applet</a>. The Sugarscape 
Environment should be 
initialised and quickly grow sugar up to the capacity of each patch; it should 
look like this after a few seconds:</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/Sugarscape2.png"></p>
<p>Suggestion: You should get used to reading what is written on each behaviour web 
page and trying to follow how the behaviour works. </p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"></p>
</font><font SIZE="4" face="Tahoma"><b>
<p>Step 2. Creating an Agent</p>
</b></font><font SIZE="3" face="Tahoma">

<p>If you run your model and look carefully you'll see the you already have an 
Agent in your model - a small triangle in the bottom-left corner. Now you will make this 
agent behave as in chapter 2 of the Growing Artificial Societies book. First go to the 
'Sugarscape Agents' section within the <a href="Sugarscape-Library.html">
Sugarscape Library</a>, 
find the 'Initialise Agent' behaviour and add it to Agent within the Composer 
area (following a similar process as in the previous step). Now go through the same steps to add behaviours that put the agent in an 
'Initial random position'. </p>
<p>Finally add behaviours that set the 'shape' and 'colour' of the Agent (you will find these 
in the Appearance and Movement sections of the Library). You can change the 
shape and colour from their defaults by opening the behaviours and changing the 
parameters within the NetLogo code on the page (for instance you might want to 
change the parameter &quot;fish&quot; to &quot;person&quot; in the shape 
behaviour). </p>

</font><font SIZE="4" face="Tahoma"><b>

<p>Step 3. Make the Agent Move</p>

</b></font><font SIZE="3" face="Tahoma">

<p>Add a behaviour to make Agent 
move to the nearest patch with the most sugar that it can see. This behaviour 
also requires you to add a behaviour that gives an Agent a preference for 
patches with more sugar.</p>
<p>When you run the model, you may see the Agent 
move a little bit before it stops. You can produce different trials by 
clicking on the 'Setup' button followed by the 'Go' button. </p>
<p>Suggestion: Think about why the agent sometimes doesn't move at all.</p>

</font><font SIZE="4" face="Tahoma"><b>

<p>Step 4. Creating a Population</p>

</b></font><font SIZE="3" face="Tahoma">

<p>Edit the field labelled 'How many instances?' to contain the variable <i>the-initial-population</i>. The value of this variable is controlled by a slider.</p>
<p>After running the model you should see the agents stopping with a pattern similar to this:</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/Sugarscape3.png"></p>

</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="CENTER"></p>

</font><font SIZE="4" face="Tahoma"><b>

<p>Step 5. Collecting and Consuming Sugar</p>

</b></font><font SIZE="3" face="Tahoma">

<p>Give the agents the behaviours of collecting and consuming sugar. A typical snapshot should look like:</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/Sugarscape4.png"></p>
<p align="left">Suggestion: Why do some of them keep moving and 
others stay still?</p>

</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="CENTER"></p>

</font><font SIZE="4" face="Tahoma"><b>

<p>Step 6. Starving Agents</p>

</b></font><font SIZE="3" face="Tahoma">

<p>Make agents die if they have no sugar. After a while the model will look like 
the following. </p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/Sugarscape5.png"></p><p>Suggestion: 
Think about the distribution of agents and the way they move.</p>

</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="CENTER"></p>

</font><font SIZE="4" face="Tahoma"><b>

<p>Step 7. Graphing the Population</p>

</b></font><font SIZE="3" face="Tahoma">

<p>Add a graph of the total population versus elapsed time. N.B. this behaviour 

should be given to the Sugarscape Environment. The graph should look like the 
following. </p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/Sugarscape6.png"></p><p>Suggestion: 
Think about why the population drops and then levels off.</p>

</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="CENTER"></p>

</font><font SIZE="4" face="Tahoma"><b>

<p>Step 8. Add a Histogram of Accumulated Sugar</p>

</b></font><font SIZE="3" face="Tahoma">

<p>Add a histogram of the distribution of sugar/wealth across the population. </p>
<p>Suggestion: Watch how the plot changes as the model runs.</p>

</font><font SIZE="4" face="Tahoma"><b>

<p>Step 9. Add a Lorenz Curve and a Monitor for the Gini Coefficient</p>

</b></font><font SIZE="3" face="Tahoma">

<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_curve">Lorenz Curve</a> and 
<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient">Gini Coefficient</a> are additional tools for observing the distribution of wealth in the Sugarscape. 
(See page 36 of <i>Growing Artificial Societies</i>.) Add behaviours that 
monitor these values. (Note you will need to add two behaviours to create the 
plotting area and to plot the graphs.) Also a monitor that displays the current 
Gini Coefficient.</p>

</font><font SIZE="4" face="Tahoma"><b>

<p>Step 10. Add Monitors for Vision Level and Sugar Metabolism</p>

</b></font><font SIZE="3" face="Tahoma">

<p>Now add monitors for Vision Level and Sugar Metabolism. </p>
<p><font SIZE="4" face="Tahoma"><b>

Step 11. Run some Experiments</b></font></p>

<p>You can use the sliders in the model as it runs in the Applet to explore the 
parameter space of the Sugarscape model. (Using models in this way is sometimes 
called <i>in silico </i>experimentation). </p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/sugarscape-sliders.png"></p><p>Run experiments 
to discover how to make large and small Gini coefficients and see which factors 
influence the carrying capacity (the stable size of the population i.e. you can 
read this from the graph at time 50). </p>
<p>Use
<a target="_blank" href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dGtlN3N2Mk8zMlFJOXU3TU1YNUp6QkE6MQ">this form</a> 
to record your findings and answer the questions. Your answers will be recorded 
in an online spreadsheet (Google Docs service) so that we can discuss this step 
later on in the class. </p>
<p>Suggestion: You can explore the stochastic nature of the model by making 
repeated runs with the same parameters.</p><font SIZE="4" face="Tahoma"><b>

<p>Step 12. Replacing dying agents</p>

</b></font>

<p>Add a behaviour so new agents are created when an agent dies. </p>
<p>Suggestion: Change the initial population to 250 and observe how death and rebirth 
affects the dynamics of the mean vision level, the mean sugar metabolism, and 

the wealth distribution. </p>

</font><font SIZE="4" face="Tahoma"><b>

<p>Step 13. Limited Lifetimes</p>

</b></font><font SIZE="3" face="Tahoma">

<p>Give the agents behaviours so they die when they reach their lifespan. </p>
<p>Suggestion: See how this affects the dynamics of the mean vision level, the mean sugar 
metabolism, and the wealth distribution. Note that the way aging is modelled 
will begin to have an effect after 60 time steps.</p>

</font><font SIZE="4" face="Tahoma"><b>

<p>Step 14. Production Causes Pollution</p>

</b></font><font SIZE="3" face="Tahoma">

<p>Add behaviours so that sugar <i>production</i> causes pollution and 

agents move to avoid polluted areas. </p>
<p>Suggestion: Observe the modified dynamics. 

Note that the production of pollution doesn't begin before 50 time steps. Sugar 

production is done by the Sugarscape Environment.</p>

</font><font SIZE="4" face="Tahoma"><b>

<p>Step 15. Consumption Causes Pollution</p>

</b></font><font SIZE="3" face="Tahoma">

<p>Add behaviours so that sugar <i>consumption</i> causes pollution. This also begins 

after 50 time steps. Sugar consumption is done by each agent.</p>

</font><font SIZE="4" face="Tahoma"><b>

<p>Step 16. Diffusing Pollution</p>

</b></font><font SIZE="3" face="Tahoma">

<p>Add a behaviour to the Sugarscape Environment so that after 100 time 

steps pollution starts to diffuse to neighbouring sites.</p>

</font><font SIZE="4" face="Tahoma"><b>

<p>Step 17. Feedback</p>

<p>Step 18. If you have time</p>

</b></font><font SIZE="3">

<p><font face="Tahoma">If you have time you could also:</font></p>
<ul>
	<li><font face="Tahoma">Replace the behaviour for growing sugar with 

one that has differential seasonal growth rates. </font></li>
	<li><font face="Tahoma">Replace the initial 

distribution of the population with one where everyone starts in the Southwest 

corner. </font></li>
	<li><font face="Tahoma">Further explore the parameter space. </font></li>
	<li><font face="Tahoma">Also NetLogo has a tool for automating the 

exploration of the parameter space. You can
	<a target="_blank" href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml">download NetLogo</a> and run your model there. Click on
