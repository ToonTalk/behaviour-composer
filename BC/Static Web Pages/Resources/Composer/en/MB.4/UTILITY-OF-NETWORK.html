	<h2>How this works</h2>

	<p>This computes a player's utility of the network formed by taking the 
	current network and adding links in the <i>additions</i> list and removing 
	those in the <i>removals</i> list. It computes the minimum network distance 
	between all other players and this player and applies the <i>
	benefit-of-link-with-distance</i> to each distance. It reports the sum of 
	these benefits minus the cost of maintaining direct links.</p>

	<h2>History</h2>



	<p>This was implemented by Ken Kahn.</p>
