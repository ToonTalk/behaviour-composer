	<h3><i>I have a preferred direction that I travel in that I balance with the 

	desired direction from social interactions.</i> </h3>

	<font size="2" color="gray">Begin NetLogo code:</font>
	<pre>substitute-text-area-for initial-preferred-direction 1 0        
substitute-text-area-for initial-direction-weight 0.5

	<h2>Variants</h2>

	<p>The &quot;preferred-direction&quot; can be any unit vector (i.e., a coordinate of a 

	circle with a radius of 1). In this example the preferred direction is east. 

	The &quot;informed-direction-weight&quot; (called &#969; in [1]) can be any non-negative 

	value. As stated in [1]</p>

	<blockquote>

		If &#969; = 0, vector <b>g</b> [&quot;preferred-direction&quot;] has no influence and 

		individuals have no desire to move in any specific direction. As &#969; 

		approaches 1, individuals tend to balance their preference to move in 

		direction <b>g</b> with their desire to maintain social interactions 

		with group members. As &#969; exceeds 1, individuals are more heavily 

		influenced by their preferred direction <b>g</b> than by their 

		neighbours.
