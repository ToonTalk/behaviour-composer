<body>

	<h3><i>I record a movie of a model's execution.</i> </h3>
	<p><i>Warning -- this does not 

	compress the movie so the file will be very large. You probably want to 

	compress the movie with some other tool subsequently. The movie is made in 
	Apple's <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickTime">QuickTime</a> 
	format but can be converted to other formats.</i></p>
	<p><i>This only works 
	when the model is run from within NetLogo. Applets can't create movies.</i></p>

	<font size="2" color="gray">Begin NetLogo code:</font>
	<pre>substitute-text-area-for movie-file-name test-movie.mov                 
substitute-text-area-for movie-duration 50  
do-after-setup
   [create-movie &quot;movie-file-name&quot; movie-duration true]
</pre>

	<font size="2" color="gray">End NetLogo code</font>
	<h2>Related Micro-behaviours</h2>
	<p><a href="SET-FRAME-DURATION.html">SET-FRAME-DURATION</a> can be used to set the 
	duration of each frame (in seconds).</p>
	<h2>Variants</h2>

	<p>You can change the file name of the movie (&quot;test-movie.mov&quot; here) and 

	the number of frames to record (50 in this example). Changing <i>true</i> to
	<i>false</i> will cause the movie to include the entire interface.</p>

	<h2><span class="mw-headline">How it works </span></h2>

	<p>This produces a QuickTime movie file named &quot;test-movie.mov&quot;. 
	The file will be created relative to the folder where the NLOGO file was 
	downloaded unless an absolute file name is given.</p>

	<h2>History</h2>



	<p>This was implemented by Ken Kahn.</p>
