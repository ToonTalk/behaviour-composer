<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>Other micro-behaviours could be added to the newly paired players.</p>
<h2>Related Micro-behaviours</h2>
<p>This adds to each node in the pair the micro-behaviours

<a title="SIMPLE-REMOVE-LINK-DECISION" href="SIMPLE-REMOVE-LINK-DECISION.html">SIMPLE-REMOVE-LINK-DECISION</a>,
<a title="ADD-A-LINK-IF-IN-AGREEMENT" href="ADD-A-LINK-IF-IN-AGREEMENT.html">ADD-A-LINK-IF-IN-AGREEMENT</a> 
and <a title="PREPARE-FOR-NEXT-TURN" href="PREPARE-FOR-NEXT-TURN.html">PREPARE-FOR-NEXT-TURN</a>.

<h2>How this works</h2>
<p>This first finds all the players that are not linked (i.e., <i>uninitialised? 
my-other-player</i>) and calls them <i>players</i>. It then generates 
two random values between 0 and the number of unpaired individuals (<i>i</i> and
<i>j</i>). It then links the player with index <i>i</i> and the player with index
<i>j</i>. It then adds micro-behaviours to the newly paired players to make decisions 
about add and removing links.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>This was implemented by Ken Kahn.</p>
