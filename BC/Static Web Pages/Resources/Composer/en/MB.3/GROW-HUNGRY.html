	<h2>Variants</h2>

	<p>Any attribute can be repeatedly changed by the desired amount in a 
	similar manner. The <i>1</i> can be changed to change the frequency this 
	run.</p>

	GROW-OLDER</a> is another way of defining an attribute (age in this case) 

	that increases with time.</p>

	<h2>How this works</h2>

	<p>This schedules the increase of the hunger attribute by 1 unit to happen 

	every second.</p>

	<h2>History</h2>



	<p>This was implemented by Ken Kahn.</p>
