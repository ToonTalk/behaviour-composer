<b>BD 3.5 Practical: 
Individual Based Models</b>
<br>
</p>
</font><font color="#111111">
<p>Here we will model a disease by building interactions of individuals rather 
than modelling mathematically with variables that represent entire populations.
</p>
<p>In the first part of the practical (1-5), you will build a model equivalent 
to the SI model you have already built in R. But the methodology here is very 
different: the program describes the behaviours of individuals and the behaviour 
of the population emerges by summing those behaviours. The SI model you built in 
R describes populations (if you recall, you were making an approximation of a 
series of differential equations). In the second part of the practical (6-10), 
you'll explore the influence of social heterogeneity on the spread of diseases. 
This would be very hard to model analytically with equations that model 
populations.</p>
<p>At various stages we ask you to enter your results electronically, and at the 
end there are two questions which we would like you to answer.</p>
<p>Please go through the instructions carefully, step-by-step. There might be 
slight differences depending upon the web browser that you are using.</p>
<p>You can return to this guide at any time by clicking on the &#39;Resources&#39; menu 
link at the top of the page.</p> 
</font>
<font size="4">
<p>
<b>Step 1. Start the program.</b>
</p>
</font>
<p>Click on&nbsp;<a href="Epidemic-Library.html">library of micro-behaviour for 
modelling epidemics</a>. This will open a new web page but you will see the same 
tabs at the top. Remember to use these tabs for navigating (not the arrows on 
your web browser). This instruction page is 'Epidemic-Guide'; the model you will 
create is at 'Behaviour Composer'; parts to put in the model are at 'Epidemic 
Library'. Clicking on the top right of the tab will remove it (if you have too 
many tabs it may be a problem for your browser window).</p>
<p>Click on
<a href="http://modelling4all.nsms.ox.ac.uk/Model?frozen=rhWNxKbEW3yVxvKRVl9u79&MforAllModel=1">INITIAL MODEL</a> to load a model containing only a population of susceptible 
individuals and some technical machinery. This model has no infected individuals 
or a mechanism for spreading an infection; these are things you will will add 
here.</p>
<font size="4"><b>
</b>
<p>
<b>Step 2. Explore the initial model</b>
</p>
</font>
<p>You should be starting with a model that includes only susceptible people.</p>
<p>Click on the <i>RUN </i>&nbsp;button in the <b>
<a href="#_BehaviourComposer_">BehaviourComposer</a></b> area. and then 
click on the &quot;Run the Model&quot; link. This will launch a Java applet running 
NetLogo in a new tab or page.
<a target="_blank" href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs">NetLogo</a> 
is a modelling tool that the Behaviour Composer builds upon.</p>
<p>Click on NetLogo's
<i>SETUP</i> button to initialise the model. Try changing the slider labelled <b>
the-initial-susceptible-population</b> and then click on the <i>SETUP </i>button 
to see its effect. To move the slider by small amounts, set it slider near the 
desired value and click the mouse to the left or right to move it by one unit.</p>
</span><span lang="EN-GB">
<p>Pressing the <i>GO</i> button does nothing since we have yet to introduce 
infected individuals or any other behaviours.</p>
<font size="4">
<p>
<b>Step 3. Create some infected individuals</b>
</p>
</font>
<p>Click on the following link to open the micro-behaviour web page: <b><a href="CREATE-INITIAL-INFECTED-POPULATION.html">
CREATE-INITIAL-INFECTED-POPULATION</a></b>. Add this to your model by clicking 
on the button at the top of the page. Selecting the menu item &#39;Add to a 
Prototype&#39; will take you to <b>
<a href="#_BehaviourComposer_">BehaviourComposer</a></b> where you then add it to <i><b>Person</b></i> by clicking on button labelled 
&#39;Person&#39;. You should 
then see the 'create the initial infected population' micro-behaviour appear in the model. Then 
click on the greyed-out micro-behaviour of the <i><b>Observer</b></i> labelled <b>
CREATE-INITIAL-INFECTED-COUNT-SLIDER</b> and select <i>Activate</i>. Run your 
model in the <b>
<a href="#_BehaviourComposer_">BehaviourComposer</a></b> and you'll see an infected individual displayed in yellow after clicking 
the <i>RUN button</i>. (Note: yellow individuals denote those infected at the 
start of the simulation, those coloured red denote subsequent infection).</p>
<font size="4">
<p>
<b>Step 4. Spread the infection</b>
</p>
</font>
<p>The simplest way to model encounters is where an individual randomly 
encounters another and probabilistically infects that person. This is 
implemented by the <b>RANDOM-ENCOUNTER</b> micro-behaviour. Browse for it and 
add it to <i><b>Person</b></i>. It needs the <b>CREATE-ENCOUNTER-RATE-SLIDER</b> 
and <b>
CREATE-INFECTION-ODDS-SLIDER</b> micro-behaviours, which are already in the list 
of <b><i>Observer</i></b> behaviours so click on them and activate them. You&#39;ll 
find these micro-behaviours in 
the <b><a href="Epidemic-Library.html">Epidemic Library</a></b>.</p>
<p>Run your model: click <i>RUN</i> from the <b>
<a href="#_BehaviourComposer_">BehaviourComposer</a></b> area, then <i>
Run the model in a new browser window or tab</i>. When the model has loaded 
click <i>SETUP</i> and finally <i>
GO</i>. You should see the infection spread.</p>
<p>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; ">
Step 5. Add plots to see what is happening</span>
<br>
</p>
<p>It is hard to get a sense of the big picture without graphs. Browse for <b>CREATE-POPULATIONS-PLOT, ADD-SUSCEPTIBLE-TO-POPULATIONS-PLOT</b> 
and <b>
ADD-INFECTED-TO-POPULATIONS-PLOT </b>&nbsp;in 
the <b><a href="Epidemic-Library.html">Epidemic Library </a></b>and add them to <b><i>Observer</i> </b>to create a graph 
and to plot the two populations.</p>
<p>In the <b>
<a href="#_BehaviourComposer_">BehaviourComposer</a> </b>run the model again and check that you see something familiar -- you may need 
to scroll down the screen to see the plot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A plot of the changes in the number infected can be very informative. Add
<a href="http://modelling4all.nsms.ox.ac.uk/Resources/Composer/en/MB.2/ADD-BEHAVIOURS.html#changes=SPb89Kg-D53j5J_Q3XDh74">ADD-CHANGE-IN-NUMBER-INFECTED-BEHAVIOURS</a> to your model.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; ">Step 
6. Replace the random encounter with one based upon social networks</span>
<br>
</p>
<p>In the above model that you have just made, each individual had an equal 
chance of contacting any other.&nbsp;We can incorporate a range of non-random 
encounters, while keeping the average number of contacts the same (we have set 
this figure to four).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the <b>
<a href="#_BehaviourComposer_">BehaviourComposer</a> </b>area<b>
</b>inactivate the <b>RANDOM-ENCOUNTER</b> behaviour and add the <b>
RANDOM-SOCIAL-ENCOUNTER</b> to <b>Person</b>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Add&nbsp;<b>INITIALISE-SOCIAL-NETWORK-CONSTANT-SYMMETRIC</b>. Here each individual 
has the same number of potential contacts, called<i> acquaintances</i>. Disease 
can transfer only between individuals that are acquaintances (symmetric just 
refers to the fact that if A is an acquaintance of B then B is also an 
acquaintance of A). Add this to <b>Observer</b> since it is one behaviour that creates 
relationships for the entire population.</p>
<p>Run this model in the <b>
<a href="#_BehaviourComposer_">BehaviourComposer</a></b>. It should not change the progression of the disease much 
compared to the one where everyone had an equal chance of contacting any other.</p>
<p>You can show lines of social contact (linking to the four 'acquaintances') 
and subsequent lines of infection by the following. Add <b>
DISPLAY-LINE-TO-EACH-OF-MY-ACQUAINTANCES</b> to <b>Person</b>. Reduce the number 
of susceptible individuals to about 10 and run the model.<br>
</p>
<p>Showing lines of contact is rather confusing with more than a handful of 
individuals so we can replace this by varying the size of the individuals in 
proportion to social contacts. Inactivate <b>
DISPLAY-LINE-TO-EACH-OF-MY-ACQUAINTANCES</b> and add <b>
SET-SIZE-PROPORTIONAL-TO-NUMBER-OF-MY-ACQUAINTANCES</b> and <b>
DISPLAY-LINE-OF-INFECTION</b> to <b>Person</b>. Since everyone has four 
acquaintances when <b>INITIALISE-SOCIAL-NETWORK-CONSTANT-SYMMETRIC</b> 
is used the sizes are the same now. Run the model&nbsp; in the <b>
<a href="#_BehaviourComposer_">BehaviourComposer</a> </b>until it stops (<b>PAUSE-EVERYTHING-WHEN</b> 
causes it to stop after 100 cycles (&quot;days&quot;).&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Step 7. Build different social networks.</font></b> <br>
</p>
<p>In reality, individuals differ in the number of other individuals with whom 
they are likely to be in infectious contact. Here we shall investigate how 
different networks can affect the spread of a disease (note, the average number 
of contacts will remain the same).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the <b>
<a href="#_BehaviourComposer_">BehaviourComposer</a> </b>and<b>
i</b>nactivate&nbsp;<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold; ">INITIALISE-SOCIAL-NETWORK-CONSTANT-SYMMETRIC </span>
<span class="Apple-style-span">and investigate the effect of using other social 
networks</span>&nbsp;(remember that you need to add the micro-behaviours and 
inactivate the previous one).<br>
</p>
<p>
<b>INITIALISE-SOCIAL-NETWORK-NORMAL-DISTRIBUTION-SYMMETRIC</b>. Here instead of 
each individual having the same number of acquaintances, we use a 
<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normal 
distribution</a> (the familiar bell-shaped curve) with mean of four, so some 
individuals have more and some have fewer acquaintances. See how more 'popular' 
individuals become infected quicker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>INITIALISE-SOCIAL-NETWORK-POWER-LAW-DISTRIBUTION-SYMMETRIC</b>. Here we use a 
power distribution to determine how many acquaintances an individual has: a 
small number have very many while most have few.&nbsp;The 
<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law">power law</a> distribution more 
accurately represents the situation in a largely sexually transmitted disease 
such as HIV in a population where some individuals have many sexual encounters 
while others have very few or none. Run the model for a second or two until you 
see different size images of people.</p>
<p>
If you might later want to model different intervention policies bookmark the 
URL is the Share tab of the <b>
<a href="#_BehaviourComposer_">BehaviourComposer</a> </b>for the current version of your model and use that URL with
<a href="Modelling-Epidemic-Interventions.html">the guide for modelling recovery 
and vaccinations</a>.</p>
<p>
<b>
<font size="4">
Step 8. Make the encounter rate depends upon the number of acquaintances.</font></b><br>
</p>
<p>
At the moment, our 
encounter rate is independent of the social network. We therefore need to make 
the encounter rate of an individual proportional to the number of their 
acquaintances.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The <a href="CREATE-ENCOUNTER-RATE-SLIDER.html" title="CREATE-ENCOUNTER-RATE-SLIDER">
CREATE-ENCOUNTER-RATE-SLIDER</a> behaviour models the same number of encounters 
per time period for all individuals. Explore the consequences of replacing it 
with <a href="CREATE-ENCOUNTER-FRACTION-SLIDER.html" title="CREATE-ENCOUNTER-RATE-SLIDER">
CREATE-ENCOUNTER-FRACTION-SLIDER</a> 
which creates a slider for the fraction of the acquaintances encountered per 
time period. Remember to remove or inactivate the old <a href="CREATE-ENCOUNTER-RATE-SLIDER.html" title="CREATE-ENCOUNTER-RATE-SLIDER">
CREATE-ENCOUNTER-RATE-SLIDER</a>.</p>
<p>Now we shall compare the three networks. In order for us to pool results from 
all of you, run an infection five times on each network and use the online forms 
(see below) to record the number of infected individuals at day 7. You 
should submit data for simulations where the 'encounter-fraction-slider' is set 
to 0.5 and the population size is 100. (Remember that the average number of 
acquaintances in the different networks is the same.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>To record your results for the different types of network use these online 
forms:</p>
<ol>

</ol>
<p>You can view the classes collective data on the 
<a href="Epidemic-Guide-Results.html" target="_blank">results page</a>. (Please 
note: there is a short delay (1-5 minutes) between data being entered and the 
histogram being plotted. You may need to refresh the results web page to see 
changes in the plots).</p>
<p></p>
<p>
<b><font size='4'>Step 9. Explore the removal of the most highly connected individuals.</font></b>
</p>
<p>By adding <a href="REMOVE-SUPER-NODES.html">
REMOVE-SUPER-NODES</a> and <a href="CREATE-NUMBER-OF-SUPER-NODES-REMOVED-SLIDER.html">
CREATE-NUMBER-OF-SUPER-NODES-REMOVED-SLIDER</a>&nbsp; to <b>Observer</b> you can 
control how many of the most highly connected individuals are removed from the 
model (perhaps they can be vaccinated or educated).</p>
<p>What effect does this have in the different networks? As in Step 8, run the 
model five times for each. Please only submit data for simulations where the 
'create-number-of-super-nodes-removed-slider' is set to 10.</p>
