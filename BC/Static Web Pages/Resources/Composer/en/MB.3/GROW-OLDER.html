	<font size="2" color="gray">Begin NetLogo code:</font>
	<pre>substitute-text-area-for cycle-duration 1                      
          
do-every cycle-duration
   [set my-next-age time - my-birth]
</pre>

	<font size="2" color="gray">End NetLogo code</font>
	<p>After every &quot;tick&quot; this sets the object's value of age to the current 

	simulation time minus the time of the object was created.</p>

	<h2>Variants</h2>

	<p>Any attribute can be repeatedly changed.</p>

	GROW-HUNGRY</a> also increases linearly with time. Age is implemented as the 

	difference between now and birth while

	<a title="GROW-HUNGRY" href="GROW-HUNGRY.html">

	GROW-HUNGRY</a> is implemented as a process that increases by one unit every 
	second (by default).</p>

	<h2>How this works</h2>

	<p>

	<a title="AGE-IS-ZERO" href="AGE-IS-ZERO.html">

	AGE-IS-ZERO</a> sets my-birth when I'm created and here I compute <i>my-age</i> 

	by subtracting the current time from my birth time.</p>

	<h2>History</h2>



	<p>This was implemented by Ken Kahn.</p>
