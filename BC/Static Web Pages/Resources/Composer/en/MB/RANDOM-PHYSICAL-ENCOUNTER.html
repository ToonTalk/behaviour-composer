	<p>This models individuals that have <i>the-encounter-rate</i> encounters per 

	time period (a week). The time period can be changed by replacing the 1 in

	<i>do-every 1</i>. </p>

	<h2><span class="mw-headline">Related Micro-behaviours </span></h2>

	<p>This relies upon the

	<a title="POSSIBLE-INFECTION" href="POSSIBLE-INFECTION.html">

	POSSIBLE-INFECTION</a> micro-behaviour to possibly infect the other.

	<a title="CREATE-ENCOUNTER-RATE-SLIDER" href="CREATE-ENCOUNTER-RATE-SLIDER.html">

	CREATE-ENCOUNTER-RATE-SLIDER</a> defines the <i>the-encounter-rate</i> variable 

	used here. </p>

	<p>The doesn't make much sense unless the agents move around.

	<a title="WANDER-RANDOMLY-BY-TURNING" href="WANDER-RANDOMLY-BY-TURNING.html">

	WANDER-RANDOMLY-BY-TURNING</a> can be used to cause them to move. If you use

	<a title="WANDER-RANDOMLY-BY-TURNING" href="WANDER-RANDOMLY-BY-TURNING.html">

	WANDER-RANDOMLY-BY-TURNING</a> you probably should start them off facing in 

	different directions by adding

	<a title="SET-RANDOM-HEADING" href="SET-RANDOM-HEADING.html">

	SET-RANDOM-HEADING</a> to <i>add-copies</i> so each copy starts off with a 

	different heading. </p>

	<a title="RANDOM-SPATIAL-ENCOUNTER" href="RANDOM-SPATIAL-ENCOUNTER.html">

	RANDOM-SPATIAL-ENCOUNTER</a> differs from this micro-behaviour in biasing

	<a title="RANDOM-ENCOUNTER" href="RANDOM-ENCOUNTER.html">

	RANDOM-ENCOUNTER</a> selects any individual. </p>

	<h2><span class="mw-headline">How this works </span></h2>

	<p>Every elapsed second or simulated week, if I'm still infected (i.e., <i>

	my-state = &quot;infected&quot;</i>) then I pick <i>the-encounter-rate</i> other 

	individuals at my patch of land (who are not dead) and give them the 

	micro-behaviour

	<a title="POSSIBLE-INFECTION" href="POSSIBLE-INFECTION.html">

	POSSIBLE-INFECTION</a>. If <i>the-encounter-rate</i> is a non-integer then the 

	remainder is compared with a random number to probabilistically include an 

	extra individual. I also sets the <i>my-last-encounter</i> variable of the 

	other individuals to me in order to keep track of how many infections I 

	cause. </p>
