	<h2><span class="mw-headline">How this works </span></h2>

	<p>This is delayed by .02 time units in order to cause this phase to happen 

	after the agents move and before they might reproduce. On every time unit it 

	computes the minimum of the food available where the agent is and the 

	agent's maximum consumption rate. The agent's size is increased by the 

	amount eaten and the patch's available food is decremented by that amount.
