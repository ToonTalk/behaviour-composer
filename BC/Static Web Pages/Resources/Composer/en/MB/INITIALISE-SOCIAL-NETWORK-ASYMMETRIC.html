	<font size="2" color="gray">Begin NetLogo code:</font>
	<pre>do-after-setup
   [set my-acquaintances 
        n-of minimum count all-individuals 5

	<h2><span class="mw-headline">Variants </span></h2>

	<p>You can change the 5 to any other number to initialise the subset of the 

	&quot;objects&quot; (or agents) that I know. This can have a distribution of different 

	number of acquaintances by replacing the &quot;5&quot; with something like &quot;round 

	within-range (random-normal 5 2) 1 10 &quot; to create a distribution with a mean of 

	5 and a standard deviation of 2 truncated to values between 1 and 10 

	inclusive. </p>

	<p>Or you may wish to replace the &quot;5&quot; with a variable defined by a slider 

	for easy experimentation. See

	<a title="INITIALISE-SOCIAL-NETWORK-NORMAL-DISTRIBUTION-ASYMMETRIC" href="INITIALISE-SOCIAL-NETWORK-NORMAL-DISTRIBUTION-ASYMMETRIC.html">

	INITIALISE-SOCIAL-NETWORK-NORMAL-DISTRIBUTION-ASYMMETRIC</a> is similar to 

	this one except the number of acquaintances is normally distributed. An 

	example of the use of this micro-behaviour is

	<h2><span class="mw-headline">How this works </span></h2>

	<p>It randomly selects 5 individuals as <i>my-acquaintances</i>. It is 

	careful to avoid creating more acquaintances than there are individuals by 

	taking the minimum of 5 and the number of individuals. This code is run 

	after setup has completed since it is typically during setup that copies are 

	created. <i>round</i> is needed to convert to an integer value. </p>

	<h2><span class="mw-headline">History </span></h2>

	<p>This was implemented by Ken Kahn. </p>
