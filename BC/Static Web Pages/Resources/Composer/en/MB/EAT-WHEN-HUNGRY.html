	<font size="2" color="gray">Begin NetLogo code:</font>

  [random-number-between 0 1 &lt;= .75 and my-hunger &gt; 50 and can-pick-one all-individuals with [distance-to-me &lt; 5]]

	<h2><span class="mw-headline">Variants </span></h2>

	<p>The level of hunger and the distance to the potential prey can be 

	changed. Other conditions can be used. </p>

	<h2><span class="mw-headline">Related Micro-behaviours </span></h2>

	<p>This relies upon

	<a title="DIE" href="DIE.html">DIE</a> and

	<a title="REDUCE-HUNGER" href="REDUCE-HUNGER.html">

	REDUCE-HUNGER</a>.

	<a title="DIE-WHEN-TOO-HUNGRY" href="DIE-WHEN-TOO-HUNGRY.html">

	DIE-WHEN-TOO-HUNGRY</a>  is the behaviour for starving if too hungry.

	<a title="GROW-HUNGRY" href="GROW-HUNGRY.html">

	GROW-HUNGRY</a> steadily increases hunger. </p>

	<h2><span class="mw-headline">How this works </span></h2>

	<p>Whenever a random number between 0 and 1 turns out to be less than .75 

	(i.e. 75% of the time) and my-hunger is greater than 50 and anyone is less 

	than 5 units away. </p>

	<h2><span class="mw-headline">History </span></h2>

	<p>This was implemented by Ken Kahn. </p>
