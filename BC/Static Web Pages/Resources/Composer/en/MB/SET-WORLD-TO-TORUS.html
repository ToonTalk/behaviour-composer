	<h3><i>I change the initial geometry of the world to be a torus. In other 

	words, when an individual moves off the edge it appears on the opposite edge 

	as if the surface has been rolled into a tube and then the ends of the tube 

	connected.</i> </h3>

	<h2><span class="mw-headline">Variants </span></h2>

	<p><i>set-world-geometry</i> expects one number which can have any of the 

	following values: </p>

	<ol>

		<li>Torus (wraps horizontally and vertically) <strong class="selflink">

		SET-WORLD-TO-TORUS</strong> </li>

		<li>Vertical cylinder (wraps horizontally)

		<a title="SET-WORLD-TO-VERTICAL-CYLINDER" href="SET-WORLD-TO-VERTICAL-CYLINDER.html">

		SET-WORLD-TO-VERTICAL-CYLINDER</a> </li>

		<li>Horizontal cylinder (wraps vertically)

		<a title="SET-WORLD-TO-HORIZONTAL-CYLINDER" href="SET-WORLD-TO-HORIZONTAL-CYLINDER.html">

		SET-WORLD-TO-HORIZONTAL-CYLINDER</a> </li>

		<li>A plane (no wrapping -- objects become invisible if beyond the 

		limits of the world)

		<a title="SET-WORLD-TO-PLANE" href="SET-WORLD-TO-PLANE.html">

		SET-WORLD-TO-PLANE</a> </li>

		<li>A plane with a camera that follows the average position of all 

		individuals

		<a title="SET-WORLD-TO-PLANE-WITH-CAMERA-FOLLOWING-CENTROID" href="SET-WORLD-TO-PLANE-WITH-CAMERA-FOLLOWING-CENTROID.html">

	<h2><span class="mw-headline">How this works </span></h2>

	<p>Due to current limitations of NetLogo this specifies only the <i>initial</i> 

	geometry of the world and cannot be used to change the world's geometry 

	during execution. </p>

	<h2><span class="mw-headline">History </span></h2>

	<p>This was implemented by Ken Kahn. </p>
