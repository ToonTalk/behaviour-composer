	<h2><span class="mw-headline">Variants </span></h2>

	<p>Any attribute can be repeatedly changed by the desired amount in a 

	similar manner. It need not be defined to happen every &quot;tick&quot;, i.e. <i>

	delta-t</i> seconds. </p>

	<h2><span class="mw-headline">Related Micro-behaviours </span></h2>

	<a title="GROW-OLDER" href="GROW-OLDER.html">

	GROW-OLDER</a> is another way of defining an attribute (age in this case) 

	that increases with time. </p>

	<h2><span class="mw-headline">How this works </span></h2>

	<p>This schedules the increase of the hunger attribute by 1 unit to happen 

	every <i>delta-t</i> seconds. </p>

	<h2><span class="mw-headline">History </span></h2>

	<p>This was implemented by Ken Kahn. </p>
